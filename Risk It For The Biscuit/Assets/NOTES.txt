1st idea:
- ambitious chef wants to make the best biscuit ever
- chef is also an experienced combatant and must fight monsters
- looting monster remains will be used as ingredients to make the biscuit
- monster difficulty scales higher as the chef progresses by killing more monsters
- chef can stop fighting anytime in order to make the biscuit with the looted remains
- basically the game is roguelike shoot em up (Vampire Survivors)

2nd idea:
- kiddie auction??

3rd idea:
- "fortinaiti i la babaji?" choices??
