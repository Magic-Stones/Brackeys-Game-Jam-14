1st idea:
- ambitious chef wants to make the best biscuit ever
- chef is also an experienced combatant and must fight monsters
- looting monster remains will be used as ingredients to make the biscuit
- monster difficulty scales higher as the chef progresses by killing more monsters
- chef can stop fighting anytime in order to make the biscuit with the looted remains
- basically the game is roguelike shoot em up (Vampire Survivors)

2nd idea:
- kiddie auction??

3rd idea:
- "fortinaiti i la babaji?" choices??

4th idea:
- adventurer finds himself trapped in a dark cave
- mining helmet or torch as source of light but without weapons
- he must find his way out while avoiding monsters harming him
- movement speed is slow
- biscuits can boost his speed with stacks and can be found throughout random places in the cave
- i've yet to have experience with developing light horror or suspense/thriller games

5th idea:
- 9 "cards" of good or bad biscuits
- player must carefully pick which card is good or bad
- completely RNG
